        <p>Uhm i'm pretty sure the only thing the game stores is your meta username and ip.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind i'm not going to use the information for anything other then banning.</p>
        <p>And I do have a secure password for <a href="https://www.photonengine.com">Photon Engine</a> and <a href="https://playfab.com">PlayFab</a>.</p>
        <p>And meta says I need to tell you how to delete your data so uhm ask PlayFab I guess?</p>
